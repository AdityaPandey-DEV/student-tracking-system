# 📧 Email Timeout Solution

## Current Issue
Emails are timing out on Render (even though test command works). This is likely due to network latency between Render and SendGrid on the free tier.

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Increased Timeout (30 seconds)
- Changed from 10s to 30s to give more time for slow connections
- Background fallback still attempts to send even after timeout

### 2. OTP Display Fallback
- When email times out, OTP code is shown directly on screen
- User can complete registration even if email doesn't arrive
- OTP is still valid and can be entered manually

### 3. Better Error Messages
- Clear timeout messages
- Instructions to check email OR use displayed OTP code

## 🧪 Testing

After deployment, try registration:
1. Register at: `/register/student/`
2. If email times out:
   - Check inbox (email might still arrive via background fallback)
   - OR use the OTP code shown on screen
   - Complete registration with displayed OTP

## 🔍 If Timeouts Continue

### Option 1: Check SendGrid Activity Log
- Go to: https://app.sendgrid.com/activity
- Check if emails are actually being sent/delivered
- Even if timeout occurs, background thread might succeed

### Option 2: Verify Network on Render
- Check Render logs for connection issues
- SendGrid might be slow to respond on free tier

### Option 3: Use Background-Only Mode
If synchronous sends keep timing out, we can switch to background-only mode (fire-and-forget) where emails always send in background threads.

## ✅ Current Behavior

When timeout occurs:
1. ✅ OTP is generated and saved
2. ✅ Timeout error is caught
3. ✅ Background thread attempts to send email (might succeed)
4. ✅ OTP code is shown to user on screen
5. ✅ User can complete registration with displayed OTP

**This ensures registration always works, even if email delivery is slow!**
